        <h2>What I did</h2>
        <p>
          In this assignment, I was required to apply a color palette to a mockup landing page design, create a dark theme that complements the color palette, and add animations to make the page more engaging. For the color palette, I experimented with different combinations of colors to find one that provided good contrast between the colors and font. The creation of a dark mode allowed me to enhance the user experience, and I also learned how to create web animations. <br />
          <br />
          This assignment helped me to think more critically about my use of color and apply color theory more effectively in my designs. Creating a dark theme was also a somewhat new experience for me. I had to ensure that the theme would not only provide a good contrast to the colors but I also had to consider accessibility issues, such as making sure the text was readable and that the contrast was sufficient. Adding animations to the landing page design was a fun and exciting part of the assignment. <br />
          <br />
          This experience taught me how animations can make a big difference in how users interact with a website and how they can be used to improve the overall user experience. Overall, the assignment helped me to improve my design skills, learn new techniques, and gain a deeper understanding of the importance of color theory.
