        <h2>What I did</h2>
        <p>
          For this assignment, I was able to build upon the knowledge I had gained in the previous assignments and apply it to a more complex design challenge. Applying CSS Flex and Grid methods to the mockup landing page design was a significant challenge, but it allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of how these methods work and how to use them to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. <br />
          <br />
          Throughout the assignment, I experimented with different techniques and approaches to optimize the layout and ensure it was accessible to a wider range of users. This included using media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes, as well as implementing responsive images and fonts to ensure they rendered correctly on all devices. <br />
          <br />
          Overall, the assignment was an excellent opportunity to improve my design skills and learn more about the principles of responsive design. It allowed me to gain valuable experience using CSS Flex and Grid methods, which I can apply to future design projects to create more dynamic and user-friendly layouts.
