        <h2>What I did</h2>
        <p>
          In this assignment, I had to work on a mockup landing page design to try out different fonts and work with UI cards. The assignment was divided into two parts, each with its own unique challenges. <br />
          <br />
          The first part required me to implement a font hierarchy, which meant selecting different font styles and sizes to create a visual hierarchy that helps the user navigate the page and identify important information. This was a crucial step in the design process because it allowed me to better consider the user experience and ensure that the font hierarchy was easy to navigate and understand. By selecting the appropriate font sizes and styles.<br />
          <br />
          In the second part of the assignment, I were tasked with designing UI cards, which are small information containers used to present content in an organized and visually appealing way. This required me to think carefully about the placement of content and the overall design of each card to ensure that they were both functional and aesthetically pleasing.<br />
          <br />
          Overall, the assignment helped me to better understand the importance of font hierarchy and UI design in creating an effective and user-friendly landing page. By carefully selecting fonts and designing UI cards.
